	NR05's data diskspace ( 8gb used, 20 available)
	Added cronjob to check diskspace

April 24th, 2007
	Tar'd and Bzipped initial syslog/strace folders (6 hours)
	Receiving approximately 3GB per day
	Strace files are cumulative (redundant), taking up lots of space
		This was done to prevent the possibility of losing log data

April 25th, 2007
	Added a script that sort/uniq the strace files 
		(data preserved through timestamps)

April 5th, 2007
	NR05's logging diskspace expanded to 250GB


May 10th, 2007
	Duy noticed NR05 was overflowing with scp calls.  
		System prevents ssh into the system with a 
		"too many files are open in system" error
		Problems occur for very long SCPs as well as
		nodes that were unstable and slow.
	Note: Although Strace data is now uniq so that redundant data doesn't 
		appear on the system, the entire cumulative file is still 
		being sent

May 11th, 2007
	NR05 rebooted

May 13th, 2007
	Logs are now sent at a random minute mark per node each hour instead of 
		being sent at xx:00, causing NR05 to thrash because of all the SCP calls 
		coming in at once

May 14th, 2007
	NR05 is still thrashing because of large number of SCP calls 
		(400 scps running, most older than an hour)

May 17th, 2007
	NR05 completely locks out ssh with 
		"ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host"

May 22nd, 2007
	Changed strace collection method to the same method we do the tcpdump 
		(rotate logs, then send them in.  New data becomes unique)
	Split Strace and Strac2 folders 
		(Strac2 folder hold the new data that is uniq, while the 
		strace folder collects any leftover data before the change)



June 13th, 2007
	NR05 rebooted, locked up in a bit over an hour
	Issued killall on scp processes

	
June 28th, 2007
	NR05 rebooted, added 256MB of Ram, and turned off X11

July 2nd, 2007
	Log files are now placed into subdirectories based on timestamp.  This 
		was done because it became incredibly inconvenient to work with 
		several hundred thousand files in a single directory, so they 
		are now divided in such a way that roughly 1000 log files are 
		stored in a single subdirectory.


July 12th
	Noticed that NR05's disk space hit 100% capacity.  The old strace 
		function appears to still be active, and we are now receiving 
		redundant syslog files due to the new directory structure 
		alongside scp failures.
	When an scp fails, all files in the scp stick around to be send the 
		next time storklog is activated.  Since there are more files, 
		there is a higher chance this scp will fail.  At the same time, 
		when an scp fails, the file is renamed back to its original file 
		name.  When the file is sent the next time, it receives a new 
		timestamp and is sent in.  This means two files with the same 
		data are stored under two different filenames.
	
July 14th
	Space is relieved by bzipping the strace files.

July 19th
	Syslog files are now sent one at a time, and are removed from the 
		nest if the file succeeds in transfering.

July 26th 2007
	Script is run to place all the syslog files into single files 
		based on nodename.  This allows us to have a directory with 
		a few hundred large files that are all sortted/uniqued, so 
		all the redundant data is eliminated
